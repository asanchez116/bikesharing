## Summary:
* Overall, males are more likely to use the bike share service and be subscribers preferring weekdays over weekends and checking out bikes on mornings over evenings. Women follow the same patterns but less significantly. 

* The exception is in length of trip where women tend to ride longer than men. Unknown gender however, is significantly higher in terms of trip duration when compared to males and females and tend to prefer weekends over weekdays with the hours tending to be more evenly spaced throughout the day.

* Two additional analysis include: 
1. Comparison of customers vs subscribers between New York and Des Moines
2. Gender comparison heatmap for starting and ending locations to see if differences in strategy for advertising bike share services would be helpful in driving utilization.
